# Data Structures & Algorithms Practice

This repository contains my practice code for data structures and algorithms.  
It includes arrays, linked lists, stacks, queues, trees, graphs, sorting, and searching.  

The goal is to learn and apply common data structures and algorithms, and prepare for coding interviews.
